# Auth, Security, and Database Improvements Checklist

This document summarizes all recent improvements and best practices implemented in the authentication, security, and database layers of the project.

## ✅ Authentication (Auth)
- [x] **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation for registration and login (email, username, password, etc.).
- [x] **Sanitization:** Trimmed and normalized user input (email, username, bio).
- [x] **Email Enumeration Protection:** `Send2FACode` endpoint always responds the same and simulates timing for non-existent users.
- [x] **Async Email Sending:** Added error recovery and logging to all goroutines sending emails (welcome, 2FA).
- [x] **Consistent Error Responses:** Standardized error and success response structures.
- [x] **Profile and Update Endpoints:** Secure and validate user profile retrieval and updates.

## ✅ Security
- [x] **Password Hashing:** Used bcrypt for password hashing (`PasswordHash`).
- [x] **Password Comparison:** Used secure comparison (`CheckPasswordSame`).
- [x] **Password Strength Validation:** Enforced strong password requirements.
- [x] **Random Code Generation:** Secure random code generation for 2FA.
- [x] **JWT and Cookie Security:** Secure token and cookie handling for authentication.
- [x] **Removed Unused/Dead Code:** Deleted unused `connectionPool` and related code from `EmailService`.
- [x] **Error Handling in Async Operations:** Added panic recovery and error logging in all async email goroutines.

## ✅ Database
- [x] **Transactional User Registration:** User registration now uses a database transaction:
  - User is only created and committed if both DB insert and welcome email succeed.
  - If email sending fails, the transaction is rolled back.
- [x] **Consistent State:** Prevented partial user creation if email sending fails.
- [x] **UserStore Improvements:** Used transactions for user creation and added error logging for all DB operations.
- [x] **Soft Deletes:** Users are soft-deleted (marked inactive) instead of hard-deleted.
- [x] **Session Management:** User session creation, update, and invalidation methods.

### Summary

- Improved input validation, error handling, and security for all auth endpoints.
- Hardened password and token management.
- Ensured database consistency and transactional integrity.
- Cleaned up unused code and improved async operation safety.
